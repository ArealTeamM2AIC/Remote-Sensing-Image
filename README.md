# Image recognition

Multi class classification for image recognition

We used a data set originally presented in a paper in the proceedings of the IEEE conference.

We kept only part of it, the 13 classes that can be assimilated to landscape/nature and not human construction.

In this repository are two different starting kits, corresponding to :

    Starting kit for working on images
    
    Starting kit for working on pre-processed images
    
For the starting kit on images, you will need to install pytorch and torchvision, which are provided with requirements.txt files.

You also have a requirements.txt file for starting_kit_preprocessed, although it will probably not be useful.

You just have to :

    pip install -r requirements.txt
