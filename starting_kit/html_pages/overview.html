<h1>Solve an Aerial image recognition problem</h1>
<h3>Brought to you by the ChaLearn</h3>
<p>The data set contains 9100 color images of size 128 <b>x</b> 128, images of 13 class, each having 700 images.
    <br> The classes are all a kind of landscapes or natural contrusction, and more specifically : <br> beach, chaparral, cloud, desert, forest, island, lake, meadow, mountain, river, sea, snowberg, wetland. 
</p>

    <br> The original data is a large-scale dataset, termed "NWPU-RESISC45", which is a publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This  dataset contains 31,500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images (256 x 256 pixels) per class.
