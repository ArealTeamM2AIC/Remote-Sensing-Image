<h1>Evaluation</h1>

<p>
The problem is a multicalss classification problem. Each sample (an image) is characterized by its 128*128 pixels. You must predict the categories of 13 classes.

<br>
You are given for training a data matrix X_train of dimension 5200 samples x 49152 (128 * 128 * 3) features
and an array y_train of labels of dimension 5200 samples. You must train a model
which predicts the labels for two test matrices X_valid and X_test, each having 1950 samples. 

<br>
There are 2 phases:
<ul>
<li> <b>Phase 1: development phase. </b> We provide you with labeled training data and unlabeled validation and test data.
Make predictions for both datasets. However, you will receive feed-back on your performance on the validation set only. 
The performance of your LAST submission will be displayed on the leaderboard.
<li> <b>Phase 2: final phase.</b> You do not need to do anything. Your last submission of phase 1 will be automatically forwarded.
Your performance on the test set will appear on the leaderboard when the organizers finish checking the submissions. 
</ul>

This sample competition allows you to submit either:
<ul>
<li> Only prediction results (no code).
<li> A pre-trained prediction model. 
<li> A prediction model that must be trained and tested. 
</ul>

The submissions are evaluated using the <b>accuracy</b> metric.
