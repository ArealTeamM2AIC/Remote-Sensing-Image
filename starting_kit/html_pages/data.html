<h1>Data</h1>

<p>
The data come from the NWPU-RESISC45 satelite dataset . See the full description <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.00121.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<p> Go to the <b>FILES</b> tab to download the data and the starting kit. The starting kit contains a very small subset of the data
for debug purposes. To prepare a challenge submission, you need to use the large dataset that you download separately.
For the dataset, you might need to split a big test set to do benchmarking!
