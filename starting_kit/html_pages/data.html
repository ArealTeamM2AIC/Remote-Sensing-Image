<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The data come from the NWPU-RESISC45 satellite dataset . As described in the&nbsp;<strong>O</strong><strong>verview section</strong>, you are provided with a sub selection of 13 classes of this dataset, each containing 700 examples of different landscapes.</p>
<p>You must create a model which is able to predict the label of image given as input.</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>FILES</strong> tab to download the data and the starting kit. The starting kit contains a very small subset of the data for debug purposes. To prepare a challenge submission, you need to use the large dataset that you download separately. For the dataset, you might need to split a big test set to do benchmarking!</p>
<p>Extra data, i.e. the other 32 classes of the original dataset can be downloaded <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1uNMs2UGvHkdvvtNI8b5bWcGkQBhPq7ZP">here</a>, in their image form (128 x 128 pixels), with each folder corresponding to one class. You will need to figure out on your own how to use them to improve performance.</p>
