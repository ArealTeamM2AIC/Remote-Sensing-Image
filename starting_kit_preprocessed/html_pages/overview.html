<h1>Solve an Aerial image recognition problem</h1>
<p>The raw data set contains 9100 color images of size 128 <strong>x</strong> 128, images of 13 class, each having 700 images. This challenge was created with preprocessed images, being vectors of 1024 features. This kind of data no longer looks like images, and we have no idea what those features can represent. <br /> The classes are some kind of landscape or a natural environment, and more specifically : <br /> beach, chaparral, cloud, desert, forest, island, lake, meadow, mountain, river, sea_ice, snowberg, wetland.</p>
<p><strong> The goal of the challenge will be to classify each example and assign it to its correct class. </strong></p>
<p><span class="tlid-translation translation"><span title="">This challenge is relatively easier than the one on the raw data.</span> <span title="">Indeed, it is possible to obtain good performance thanks to a wide choice of learning algorithm, whether with deep learning or a simpler algorithms.</span></span></p>
