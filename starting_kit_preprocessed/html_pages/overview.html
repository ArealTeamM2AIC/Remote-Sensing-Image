<h1>Solve an Aerial image recognition problem</h1>
<p>The raw data set contains 9100 color images of size 128 <b>x</b> 128, images of 13 class, each having 700 images. This challenge was created with preprocessed images, being vectors of 4096 features, mostly composed of 0, though we kept the full data and not a sparse representation. This kind of data no longer looks like images.
    <br> The classes are all kinds of landscapes or natural contructions, and more specifically : <br> beach, chaparral, cloud, desert, forest, island, lake, meadow, mountain, river, sea_ice, snowberg, wetland.

    <b>
        The goal of the challenge will be to classify each example and assign it to its correct class.

    <br> The original data is a large-scale dataset, termed "NWPU-RESISC45", which is a publicly available benchmark for REmote Sensing Image Scene Classification (RESISC), created by Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU). This  dataset contains 31,500 images, covering 45 scene classes with 700 images (256 x 256 pixels) per class.
