<h1>Solve Fisher's Famous Iris Problem</h1>
<h3>Brought to you by the ChaLearn</h3>
<p>This is the well known Iris dataset from Fisher's classic paper (Fisher, 1936). The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. 
One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other. </p>
